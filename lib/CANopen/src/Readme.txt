    Topic: Features

    Library is written on object-oriented way. Code for each CANopen object is
    split into two files: *.c and *.h. There are no global variables necessary.
    In general, application first defines object. In the Communication reset
    section it initializes it with the _init function. In the endless loop then
    calls the _process function.

    Since library is object oriented, multiple configurations are possible with
    processors with two CAN interfaces, for example: two independent CANopen
    devices on one processor; one CANopen device, but some fast PDOs are on second
    CAN interface.

    Source files, ordered in the following order:
        - <CO_driver.h> describes CAN module object (microcontroller specific).
        - <CO_OD.h> describes object dictionary and all variables inside it.
          Variables are structured into three memory blocks, so different non-volatile
          strategies are possible for each block. See <CO_SDO.h> for more information.
          This file is not a part of the stack, it belongs to specific project.
          Files are automatically generated by 'Object Dictionary editor', which is part
          of CANopenNode project.
        - <CO_SDO.h> describes CANopen SDO server object (SDO slave). Expedited
          and segmented transfers are implemented.
        - <CO_Emergency.h> describes CANopen Emergency object and error control.
          All stack errors are reported here. Application can also report its own errors.
        - <CO_NMT_Heartbeat.h> describes CANopen NMT and Heartbeat producer object.
        - <CO_SYNC.h> describes CANopen SYNC object.
        - <CO_PDO.h> describes CANopen Process Data Object. Dynamic PDO mapping
          has granularity of one byte. PDO transmission can be triggered by:
          event timer, selective change of state with inhibit timer, SYNC object.
        - <CO_HBconsumer.h> describes CANopen Heartbeat consumer object.
        - <CO_SDOmaster.h> describes CANopen SDO client object (SDO master). Expedited
          and segmented transfers are implemented.
